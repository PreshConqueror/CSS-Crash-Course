			<h1>Hello World</h1>
			<p>Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.
			I’m not cute or built to suit a fashion model’s size   
			But when I start to tell them,
			They think I’m telling lies.
			I say,
			It’s in the reach of my arms,
			The span of my hips,   
			The stride of my step,   
			The curl of my lips.   
			I’m a woman
			Phenomenally.
			Phenomenal woman,   
			That’s me.</p>

		<div class="box-2">
			<h1>Goodbye World</h1>
			<p>I walk into a room
				Just as cool as you please,   
				And to a man,
				The fellows stand or
				Fall down on their knees.   
				Then they swarm around me,
				A hive of honey bees.   
				I say,
				It’s the fire in my eyes,   
				And the flash of my teeth,   
				The swing in my waist,   
				And the joy in my feet.   
				I’m a woman
				Phenomenally.

				Phenomenal woman,
				That’s me.

				Men themselves have wondered   
				What they see in me.
				They try so much
				But they can’t touch
				My inner mystery.
				When I try to show them,   
				They say they still can’t see.   
				I say,
				It’s in the arch of my back,   
				The sun of my smile,
				The ride of my breasts,
				The grace of my style.
				I’m a woman
				Phenomenally.
				Phenomenal woman,
				That’s me.

			<p>Now you understand
			Just why my head’s not bowed.   
			I don’t shout or jump about
			Or have to talk real loud.   
			When you see me passing,
			It ought to make you proud.
			I say,
			It’s in the click of my heels,   
			The bend of my hair,   
			the palm of my hand,   
			The need for my care.   
			’Cause I’m a woman
			Phenomenally.
